## Overview

Workout tracker app using technologies such as MariaDB, Java, JavaScript, and Spring. Currently, users can add different workouts to plan their weekly workout routine, as well as create custom ones. A total of 10 CRUD APIs exist to give the front end its functionality. The system is currently being updated to use NoSQL and JSPs have been implemented for modularity.

## Key Features

- **Workout Planning**: Create and manage weekly workout routines
- **Custom Workouts**: Build personalized workout plans
- **CRUD Operations**: 10 comprehensive APIs for full functionality
- **Database Integration**: MariaDB for data persistence
- **Modular Architecture**: JSPs for improved code organization
- **Future-Ready**: Migration to NoSQL in progress

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Backend development
- **Spring Boot**: Application framework
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **MariaDB**: Relational database
- **JavaScript**: Frontend interactivity
- **HTML/CSS**: User interface
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive design framework
- **JSP**: Server-side rendering for modularity

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a comprehensive CRUD API system taught valuable lessons in RESTful API design and database management. Implementing Spring Security for user authentication added complexity but improved the application's security posture. The ongoing migration to NoSQL is providing insights into different database paradigms and their trade-offs.

## Outcome

The application provides a functional workout tracking system with robust backend APIs and an intuitive frontend. The modular JSP architecture makes the codebase maintainable and extensible, while the planned NoSQL migration will improve scalability for future enhancements.
