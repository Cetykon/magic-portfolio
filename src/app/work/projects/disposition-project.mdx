## Overview

Developed a comprehensive machine learning classification system for military warehouse waste management during my internship at Telic Corporation. The system classifies over 100,000 asset disposition images across 2,449 categories with 97.69% classification accuracy using MobileNetV2. The solution includes both a mobile app for real-time, on-site classification and a desktop GUI for high-volume batch processing, significantly streamlining resource recovery operations.

## Key Features

- **PyQt6**: Desktop GUI framework for batch processing interface
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and image processing
- **YOLO**: Object detection capabilities

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a classification system capable of accurately categorizing assets across 2,449 categories required extensive data preprocessing and model fine-tuning. Achieving 97.69% accuracy on such a large number of categories was a significant challenge that required careful architecture selection and hyperparameter optimization. Implementing MobileNetV2 provided an optimal balance between accuracy and mobile performance, enabling real-time classification on mobile devices.

Developing both mobile and desktop interfaces required understanding different platform constraints and user needs. The mobile app needed to be lightweight and responsive for field use, while the desktop GUI needed to handle high-volume batch processing efficiently. Integrating the ML model into both platforms while maintaining consistent accuracy across different deployment environments was a key technical achievement.

Working with military warehouse data and waste management systems provided valuable experience in domain-specific ML applications and the importance of accuracy in critical operational systems.

## Outcome

The system successfully automates the classification of military warehouse assets, significantly improving the efficiency of resource recovery operations. The high accuracy rate (97.69%) ensures reliable categorization across thousands of asset types, while the dual-platform approach provides flexibility for both field operations and bulk processing. The project demonstrates practical application of machine learning in real-world industrial settings, showcasing skills in ML model development, mobile app development, and desktop application design.
