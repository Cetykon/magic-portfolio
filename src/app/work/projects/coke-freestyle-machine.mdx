## Overview

Developed a touchscreen interface simulating a Coke Freestyle Machine with customizable drink and ounce selection, supporting 1,000+ mixing combinations. Included real-time reporting on usage statistics and fluid levels.

## Key Features

- **Touchscreen Interface**: Intuitive UI designed for touch interactions
- **1,000+ Mixing Combinations**: Advanced drink mixing and flavor customization
- **Real-time Reporting**: Usage statistics and fluid level monitoring
- **Backend Logic**: Robust drink mixing algorithms and inventory management
- **User Experience**: Smooth interactions mimicking the real machine experience

## Technologies Used

- **.NET (C#, VB)**: Primary development languages and framework
- **MSSQL**: Database for drink inventory, usage statistics, and fluid levels
- **Touchscreen Interface**: Intuitive UI designed for touch interactions

## Challenges and Learnings

Learning the .NET framework while building a complex application was both challenging and rewarding. Implementing the drink mixing logic required careful algorithm design to handle various flavor combinations. Creating a touchscreen-friendly interface that felt natural and responsive was another key learning experience.

## Outcome

The project successfully demonstrates proficiency with the .NET framework and provides a functional recreation of the Coke Freestyle Machine interface. The application showcases skills in both frontend UI design and backend logic implementation.
