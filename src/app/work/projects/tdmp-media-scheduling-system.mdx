## Overview

Engineered a media scheduling and inventory platform using Spring Boot and React, supporting 300+ students and automating 100% of equipment reservations, checkouts, and returns. Configured and deployed MariaDB database on Sevella, backend services via Render, and frontend React app via Netlify, enabling reliable, full-stack access for students and faculty.

## Key Features

- **Equipment Management**: Comprehensive inventory tracking and management system for media production equipment
- **Reservation System**: Streamlined booking process for both staff and students
- **Account Management**: Secure user authentication and role-based access control
- **Security**: JWT token-based authentication with password encryption
- **Database Integration**: MariaDB for reliable data storage and retrieval

## Technologies Used

- **Java Spring (Maven)**: Backend architecture and framework
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Google Email API**: Email notification system
- **MariaDB**: Relational database management
- **React.js**: Frontend user interface
- **Docker**: Containerization and deployment

## Deployment

- **Database**: MariaDB on Sevella
- **Backend**: Render
- **Frontend**: Netlify
- **URL**: tdmpreservations.netlify.app

## Challenges and Learnings

Working as a Software Developer Intern, I gained valuable experience in full-stack development and cloud deployment. Implementing secure authentication with JWT tokens and integrating the Google Email API required careful API design and security considerations. Automating 100% of equipment reservations, checkouts, and returns for 300+ users presented scalability challenges that were solved through careful database design and efficient backend architecture. Deploying across multiple platforms (Sevella, Render, Netlify) taught valuable lessons in cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices.

## Outcome

The system successfully automates the entire equipment rental process for 300+ digital media students, making it easier for both staff and students to manage media production equipment. The secure authentication system ensures data protection while the intuitive React interface provides a smooth user experience. The project is deployed and actively used by the department, demonstrating production-ready full-stack development capabilities.
