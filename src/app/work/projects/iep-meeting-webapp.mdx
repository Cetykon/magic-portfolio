## Overview

The chatbot simulates an IEP conversation between a teacher and a parent. Parent personality and meeting reason are parameters that can be chosen. The front end, built with React, connects to two Python APIs that interface with the GPT API.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: GPT API integration for natural conversation simulation
- **Customizable Scenarios**: Adjustable parent personality and meeting reason parameters
- **Dual API Architecture**: Two Python APIs for comprehensive conversation handling
- **React Frontend**: Modern, responsive user interface
- **Educational Tool**: Helps teachers practice IEP meeting scenarios

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend API development
- **Flask**: Web framework for API endpoints
- **GPT API**: OpenAI integration for conversational AI
- **React**: Frontend user interface
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for AI interactions

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating with the GPT API required careful prompt engineering to ensure realistic and appropriate conversation simulations. Managing two separate APIs while maintaining conversation context was a technical challenge. The project provided valuable experience in working with AI APIs and designing conversational interfaces.

## Outcome

The application successfully simulates realistic IEP meeting conversations, providing a valuable training tool for educators. The customizable parameters allow for diverse scenario practice, while the GPT integration ensures natural and contextually appropriate dialogue.
