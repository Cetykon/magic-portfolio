## Overview

Implemented a personalized book recommendation system using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model on a 39,000+ entry dataset. Processed user book collections via backend APIs to generate tailored suggestions. Delivered a responsive GUI with search and rating features. Led the team as Team Lead during this project.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning**: KNN algorithm for intelligent book recommendations
- **Personalized Suggestions**: Recommendations based on user reading history
- **Backend API**: Python-based RESTful API for recommendation engine
- **Frontend Integration**: React frontend for user interaction
- **Collaborative Development**: Team-based project with clear role division

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend development and ML implementation
- **Flask**: Web framework for API development
- **React**: Frontend user interface
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe frontend development
- **KNN Algorithm**: Machine learning for recommendation engine on 39,000+ entry dataset

## Challenges and Learnings

Implementing the KNN algorithm for book recommendations required understanding both the mathematical principles behind the algorithm and how to apply it effectively to book data. Building a robust backend API that could handle various input formats and return meaningful recommendations was a key challenge. Working in a team environment taught valuable lessons in code organization and API design for collaborative development.

## Outcome

The application successfully provides personalized book recommendations using machine learning. The Python backend effectively processes user reading history and generates relevant suggestions, demonstrating practical application of ML algorithms in a real-world scenario.
