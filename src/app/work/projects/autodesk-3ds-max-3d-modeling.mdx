## Overview

In 3ds Max, I created a meticulously crafted chess setup featuring a detailed board, pieces, and a classic pedestal table with two chairs. Each element was carefully textured, and I used smooth camera movements to animate the scene, showcasing the chess set from all angles. The lighting and shadows add depth, highlighting the quality and realism of the model and textures, making the scene feel dynamic and immersive.

## Key Features

- **Detailed 3D Modeling**: Precise modeling of chess pieces, board, and furniture
- **Professional Texturing**: High-quality textures applied to all elements
- **Camera Animation**: Smooth camera movements showcasing the scene from multiple angles
- **Lighting Design**: Professional lighting setup with realistic shadows
- **Scene Composition**: Thoughtful arrangement creating an immersive environment

## Technologies Used

- **Autodesk 3ds Max**: 3D modeling and animation software
- **3D Modeling**: Polygon modeling techniques
- **Texturing**: UV mapping and material application
- **Animation**: Keyframe animation for camera movements
- **Rendering**: High-quality scene rendering

## Challenges and Learnings

Creating realistic textures and materials required understanding of material properties and lighting interaction. Animating smooth camera movements while maintaining visual interest was a creative challenge. The project taught valuable lessons in 3D scene composition and the importance of lighting in creating realistic renders.

## Outcome

The final render successfully demonstrates proficiency in 3D modeling, texturing, and animation. The chess set scene showcases attention to detail and professional-level work in 3D graphics, highlighting skills in both technical modeling and artistic composition.
